She uses a method called \"the Square Root\" based on  the Mexican tradition of making clothing from squares and rectangles. This process emphasizes forms of fabric  and delicate, thoughtful construction based on whole fabric, as opposed to cutting in curves and molding to  the body.\nThe Barefoot Designer is multi-faceted exhibition consisting of garments, textiles, drawings, photographs, performance, video,  workshops and source materials demonstrating Fernández's multi-layered design process. A key component of that process is her design workshop Taller Flora, a mobile laboratory that collaborates with Mexico's indigenous communities, a sustainable business model based on close collaboration with and recognition of local knowledge and talent. During her  career, Fernández has worked with many indigenous communities throughout Mexico. The exhibition will highlight the styles and techniques of five states: Chiapas, Yucatan, Campeche, the State of Mexico and Mexico City.\nMobility and collaboration can be seen and felt throughout the exhibition: in its installation, multiple films and monthly dance  performances, as well as workshops for the public. The garments and mannequins are positioned on life-sized, mobile  displays. Fernández has also activated the garments through a live and filmed dance performance by dancers Raushan Mitchell  and Silas Reiner, bringing to life the notion of \"clothing as canvas.\" The exhibition will include short process videos of weavers, embroiderers, and carpenters by photographer and filmmaker Ramiro Chaves, as well as fashion films produced by Chaves and Pedro Torres in New York City, Boston and Mexico City. A series of fashion photos by photographer Graciela Iturbide will be on view. A large workshop table adds a hands-on visitor experience to the exhibition, with a variety of workshops scheduled. Fernández will run a two-day clothing workshop as well as workshops with the Gardner's School and  Community Partnership Programs.\n\"I want people to understand that you can find happiness many different ways, and one way is by creating goods by hand and making things unique to the artist,\" Fernández said. \"Discovering the process helps people to understand how these different worlds work, because you fall in love with the artisan, and then you fall in love with the piece. You can create a whole economy  based on the artists, and how their work is made.\"\nLearn more about Carla Fernández's residency at the Gardner Museum.\nCarla Fernández: The Barefoot Designer: A Passion for Radical Design and Community is made possible with generous support from The Coby Foundation, Ltd. and the National Endowment for the Arts, with additional assistance from the Consulate General of Mexico in Boston.

Creating a version of this quintessential Islamic image for her adopted city of Boston, the artist seeks to diffuse the prevailing tension between East and West by bringing visitors in contact with the unfamiliar through visual art.\n\"Last summer,\" Abbas says, \"I found this cheap plaster imitation of the Kaaba door in my mother's house in Lahore. It was hanging askew with a sizable layer of dust, which is not surprising for my mom, where chaos takes another meaning all together. However, it made me take notice of similar happenings in other places, while visiting friends and family and during my interaction with people in public spaces, so eventually I started documenting them.

CORRESPONDENCE features design process and construction drawings of the new garden, as well as communications between the design team and contractors responsible for its construction. The exhibition centers on a pair of letters between Museum director Anne Hawley and Van Valkenburgh describing their aspirations for the new garden at the beginning of the design process. The exhibition also presents photographs that illustrate how greatly the garden has changed over the years.\nVan Valkenburgh’s design of the Monk’s Garden interprets the Museum’s meandering gallery layout, and the rich colors and textures of its idiosyncratic collection, in a contemporary landscape context. While the garden is accessible (weather permitting) from both the original Museum building and Renzo Piano’s new addition, it is not the primary connection between them, freeing it to focus instead on cultivating a sense of place. The garden is given its own interior, with the aim of provoking extended quiet contemplation rather than hurried passage.\nThe original high brick wall of Fenway Court surrounds the garden, and the design aims to soften this enclosure through the creation of a small-scale, dreamlike woodland. Composed of approximately 60 trees including stewartia, paper bark maple, and gray birch, the groves establish a detail-rich palette of colors and textures suitable for intimate appreciation. Winding paths, paved in a striking combination of black brick and reflective mica schist, meander through the trees. Rather than intersecting, the paths playfully meet and diverge, while also gently widening in places to create nooks for garden chairs.

Originally commissioned by the Madison Square Park Conservancy in New York City, where it was on view during the summer of 2013, Genger’s project is a notable collaboration for both MSPC and deCordova, as it marks the first collaboration between the two institutions.Red, Yellow and Blue features Genger’s renowned usage of hand-knotted, paint-covered rope, configured in bright, undulating walls in three primary colors that wind through deCordova’s 30-acre lawn, pathways, and hillsides. At deCordova, the work is comprised of about 1 million feet of rope collected from the Eastern seaboard and 3,500 gallons of paint, weighing in at over 100,000 pounds. Red, Yellow and Blue is adapted from its initial presentation in New York City’s Madison Square Park to the contours of deCordova’s grounds. The miles of crocheted and layered rope articulate the topography of the Sculpture Park, reference the familiar low-lying stone walls that line the New England countryside, and offer fresh opportunities to engage with the landscape.“For its second life at deCordova,” Genger notes, “I wanted to create a piece that would encourage visitors to travel through the Sculpture Park grounds as opposed to holding visitors in a space as it did in Madison Square Park. Like an elongated sentence meandering through the landscape, Red, Yellow and Blue will move and transition from ground to ground and color to color.”Genger’s piece alludes to the work of modernist abstract painter Barnett Newman’s 1960s painting series Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue?, and Minimalist sculpture by artists such as Richard Serra, Robert Morris, and Tony Smith. Genger’s installation, however, stands in sharp contrast to their industrially made, assertive monumental forms. The woven sculpture makes visible the thousands of hours of labor by a team of people to create a work not made by a machine. According to Genger, “I wanted to create a work that would impress in scale but still engage rather than intimidate. The tradition of knitting caries the sharing of stories and the installation draws on that idea.”Credit and thanks:Orly Genger, Red, Yellow and Blue, 2013 © Orly Genger, commissioned by the Madison Square Park Conservancy, New York, NY; loaned courtesy of the Madison Square Park Conservancy, Larissa Goldston Gallery, and Orly Genger.

The eight-member artist collective casts the freewheeling tire treads in tinted concrete, to give permanence to the normally ephemeral tracks, and to place the vehicle in dialogue with the more traditional sculptures that surround it. By deliberately crashing “lowbrow” thrillcraft culture into the “highbrow” space of fine art, Okay Mountain orchestrates the kind of witty cultural collision for which they are known. Based in Austin, TX, the artists of Okay Mountain (Carlos Rosales-Silva, Corkey Sinks, Josh Rios, Justin Goldwater, Ryan Hennessee, Nathan Green, Peat Duggins, Michael Sieben, Sterling Allen, Tim Brown), have been working collaboratively since 2006 when they formed an artist-run alternative gallery. Since then, the group has exhibited their installation projects throughout the United States and in Mexico City. Their large-scale sculptural projects blend humor with a big Texan mentality and aesthetic, are rife with art historical references and laced with social critique. With 4-Wheeler Rollover, the art historically savvy artists riff off the long and hallowed tradition of Land Art by taking the Sculpture Park—once the manicured lawn of Julian de Cordova—as their canvas, but revisit this history through the unexpected language of American consumer culture and recreation. The collective carves up the Park with a wink, a nod, and a slight jab at Land Artists like Michael Heizer, who excavated huge trenches and choreographed lyrical motorcycle track drawings in the desert. Their brand of smart, bawdy interventions coyly critique the institutionalization of art and invite us all along for the ride.Okay Mountain has exhibited at Freight + Volume, NY; Austin Museum of Art, TX; Galeria Enrique Guerrero in Mexico City, Mexico; Paragraph in Kansas City, KS; PULSE in Miami,FL; Texas State University in San Marcos, TX; the Creative Research Lab in Austin, TX; Prosect 1.5 in New Orleans, LA; the Blaffer Art Museum, Houston, TX; and McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, TX.

Among other things, Barman’s work addresses the constant cycle of building-destroying-rebuilding and the intersection of art and architecture; it also raises questions about the life of material and the potential value of detritus.Barman works primarily with decrepit bricks, metal, and other industrial rubble—materials inherently representative of the building up and breaking down of civilization. Often, Barman’s work juxtaposes rural elements with an urban environment in sculptural forms and site-specific interventions. Barman’s Untitled installation, sited on deCordova Sculpture Park’s main lawn, contrasts the urban with the suburban by bringing the ruins of recently leveled city buildings to deCordova’s pristine campus.Untitled is formed of a series of walls, each created by stacks of local architectural demolition rubble that are meticulously placed within an open metalwork frame. The dense, jagged wreckage contrasts greatly with the undulating metal frame, which is comparatively delicate in appearance despite its rigidity.  The open weave of the frame simultaneously contains and exposes the rubble, creating a permeable boundary between the dirtied remnants of civilization and the unspoiled park environment. The artist mediates this relationship using metalwork, crafted into stylized botanical forms, created in his native Kolkata. In this way, the work is both site-specific and universal: it encourages viewers to reconsider how they relate to their built surroundings and to meditate on the factors that drive creation and destruction on an international level.Barman is the first South Asian artist to exhibit in the Sculpture Park and this installation is indicative of deCordova’s mission to present an increasing variety of work by international artists. This project is made possible by a collaboration with the Creative India Foundation. A version of this work, featuring the same metal armature, was first installed at the Sculpture Park at Frieze New York in the spring 2012.Rathin Barman holds a BVA and MVA from the Faculty of Visual Arts, Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata. Barman’s work has been featured in group exhibitions at Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata; Gallery Kolkata; and Frieze Art Fair, New York.

In his abstract creations, Surls plays with dueling themes of nature and industrialization, and explores how materials such as bronze, plastic, and steel can be manipulated into an expression of humanity. Raised in rural Texas, Surls developed an interest in the complex relationship between nature and machinery while working on oil industry pipelines, a bond that inspires much of his sculpture.In Walking Flower Times the Power of Five, Surls employs his recurring motif of a beautiful flower to represent the softer, more majestic side of human nature while contrasting it with the hardness of the wheel-like botanical’s bare branches. The result is a surreal flower that seems as though it is breathing and alive and could walk or roll away at a moment’s notice. Though made of steel, Surls’ sculpture has an organic quality that appears simultaneously earthly and otherworldly.The title, Walking Flower Times the Power of Five, reminds us of the science in nature and the presence of numerical permutations in our everyday surroundings. The sculpture has a core of five arms whose branches double and then quadruple until there are a total of one hundred arms. With every extension yielding a factor of five, Surls allows the viewer to see the logic that is omnipresent in the chaotic beauty of nature.James Surls received a BS from Sam Houston State College and a MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art. He taught at Southern Methodist University and the University of Houston until 1982. In 1979, he helped to establish the Lawndale Art and Performance Center in Houston, a space for local artists to expose a wider audience to contemporary art. In the midst of Lawndale and his teaching career, Surls moved to Splendora, Texas which marked the beginning of a twenty year period of intense artistic productivity. His retrospective: James Surls: The Splendora Years; 1977-1997 came to deCordova in 2006.  Walking Flower Times the Power of Five was displayed in 2012 on the Rose F. Kennedy Greenway in the center of downtown Boston and was also exhibited in 2009 for the Art in the Parks Program on Park Avenue in New York City.", "image"=>"http://www.decordova.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/exhibit_feature_image_new/S/surls_1.jpg", "dates"=>"On View Nov 30, 2012")

His work consists of simple, often colorful gestures that ask viewers to stop and consider, or reconsider, an object for its most formal qualities. Feher’s The Nothing Before Something is an example of the artist’s playful brand of sculptural intervention, turning a utility pole into a monument to color and dazzle.The Nothing Before Something is a wooden, forty-five foot utility pole painted DayGlo pink. Set against the subtle seasonal variations of the Sculpture Park, Feher’s sculpture glows with an almost electric hum. This visual dissonance, between the organic green of the Park and the chemical glow of The Nothing Before Something, highlights the irony and comical artificiality of the gleaming pink pole. Replanted amidst a grove of pines at deCordova, the soaring, tapering timber’s origin as a tree is made evident, subtly questioning the stark juxtaposition between the natural and unnatural.   Painted an arresting fluorescent, the sculpture seems to radiate energy as it glows in response to long-wave ultraviolet sunlight. The sculpture’s title, The Nothing Before Something, alludes to “The Singularity”, the nanosecond immediately preceding the Big Bang and the creation of the Universe. Invoking this moment of both emptiness and infinite potential, Feher asks viewers to think about creation—artistic, scientific and otherwise.Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1956, Feher received a BA from the University of Texas in 1978 and currently resides in New York City. He has exhibited extensively in the United States and internationally.

Photo by Douglas Parker, courtesy of Chris Burden Studio.\n\n\nIn his pioneering performances of the 1970s, Los Angeles-based artist Chris Burden (b. 1946) gained a reputation for testing limits: of his own body, and of institutions and publics variously implicated in his provocative actions. Both beautiful and extreme, iconic performances like Shoot (1971), TV Hijack (1972), and Transfixed (1974) forced viewers to confront the most pressing moral and political issues of the day through allegory and metaphor.  Burden considered these early performances live sculptures in space. Beginning in the late-1970s, his interests turned from these live sculpture events and towards the production of permanent three-dimensional objects.  \nCHRIS BURDEN: THE MASTER BUILDER presents a near comprehensive account of Burden’s small-scale Erector set bridges.  Modeled after bridges imagined and real, the artist’s Erector set sculptures extend his work as a social engineer, demonstrating his dual commitment to empirical and symbolic inquiry.  Burden’s bridges are constructed from vintage and reproduced Meccano and Erector parts, perforated metal construction toys first marketed at the start of the 20th century. As part of The Master Builder, Burden is constructing a two-story Erector set skyscraper that will be installed in the museum in April.\nIn addition to this exhibition, the Rose has commissioned Chris Burden to create a permanent, outdoor sculpture for the museum’s front lawn entitled Light of Reason, which will be completed in fall 2014.", "image"=>"http://brandeis.edu/rose/images/2014s/Rose Art Museum Chris Burden Victoria Falls Bridge 72.jpg", "dates"=>"")

The artist’s videos and the sculptural environments that contain them re-imagine space and time to bring fantastical narratives of production and consumption to life, and the resulting installations disorient and transport the viewer to a place where weird and wonderful production lines abide by their own hermetic, relentless logic. Rich in material eccentricity, marginal subjectivities, and narrative absurdity, Mika Rottenberg takes the world we share apart and returns it to us in a form that is as strange and foreign as it is deeply felt and resonant.\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a monograph on the artist with essays by Christopher Bedford, Julia Bryan-Wilson, and Wayne Koestenbaum.", "image"=>"http://brandeis.edu/rose/images/2014s/Rose Art Museum Rottenberg Squeeze 1 72.jpg", "dates"=>"")

Each project series will consist of three exhibitions addressing different aspects of a thematic, scholarly concern. Since the 1970s, “project” exhibitions in U.S. museums have focused on monographic presentations of young artists in an effort to inject the contemporary into institutional contexts. With the aim of foregrounding curatorial thought and creativity, Rose Projects, by contrast, emphasizes the timeliness of the idea structuring the related projects, marrying careful scholarship to adventurous thinking. Rose Projects 1, organized by Curator at Large Katy Siegel, focuses on artists who refuse the categorical divides between representation and materialist abstraction, image and object, looking instead for different models of reality through paintings that exist on the threshold between the recognizable and the unknown. \nThe first of Siegel’s three exhibitions brings together artists from different historical moments: Wols, born Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze (1913–1951) and Charline von Heyl (b. 1960). Wols and von Heyl use traditional mediums in non-traditional ways, broadening and reveling in the spectrum of possible colors, surfaces, and images they can produce.

Through lighting, color, texture, costume, soundtrack, and props, she creates transgressive, funny, and highly stylized visual settings that owe more to theater than to conventional narrative cinema. Curnier Jardin’s stories reveal a fascination with monsters, decorative objects, and animals, although her work expresses a particular awareness of the roles women have played in mythology, folklore, and conventional narrative cinema, roles that are commonly stereotyped as saint, witch, mother, or mystic. Curnier Jardin supports a generous, intelligent, non-systematic vision of continuity between human and nonhuman bodies—humans consume dirt, cave walls dance, a pear is covered with hair.  While humans take on animal qualities, things take on human traits, such as love and longing. Usually associated with femininity and passivity, she looks to passion—traditionally opposed to “masculine” reason—as primary to sensations, perceptions, and the subject’s—or object’s—potential for action. More broadly, her work confounds the logic that divides human and nonhuman, rationality and emotion, sacred and profane, ally and enemy, masculine and feminine, showing instead how each is capable of interacting and combining.  By blending the sound and meaning of distinct words and mixing disparate ideas, characters, and environments, her work serves as a receptacle for new kinds of speech, new ways of using language, and new kinds of meaning. Her expansive “portmanteau” approach opens up possibilities for an alternative realm in which speaking is a fundamental fact about rocks and plants, animals and things, and where otherwise marginalized human voices, ethnicities, and desires have, in the words of filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger, “alternatives, possibilities, and the freedom to do wonderful things.” List Projects: Pauline Curnier Jardin features three of Curnier Jardin’s most recent films as well as objects related to the films’ development and realization. In Grotta Profunda (2011, 30 min.), Bernadette—a visionary inspired by the eponymous saint—sees and hears a siren-like religious apparition, an experience that causes her to search for the truth about the origins of humanity deep inside a nearby cave. Here Bernadette encounters, among other characters, a “monkey-mermaid” as the possible evolutionary origin of the human species, the Venus of Willendorf, and death personified as a crab-woman.  Drawing on woman’s films of the 1930s and 1940s and the artist’s own experiences, Le Salon d’Alone (2008-2010, 34 min.) is an “objects optic opera” that investigates a woman’s increasing loneliness and desperation as the only human left on earth, in which eight hybrid objects—including a “log-flute” and a “hair-pear”—begin to narrate their own stories through song. Coeurs de Silex (Hearts of Flint, 2012, 39 min.) builds off the traumatic history of a small Parisian suburb, Noisy-le-Sec, bombed by the Allies in 1944. The film—set in a “non-time,” both post- and pre-apocalyptic—takes place over the course of four days in 2012 during which an ally, occupant, witch, mystic, trainer, and child, all wearing the uniform of the track suit, improvise roles related to the physical and emotional consequences of war. About the ArtistPauline Curnier Jardin was born in 1980 in Pertuis, France and grew up in Marseilles. She graduated in 2006 from both the École nationale supérieure d’arts de Cergy-Pontoise in Paris and the École nationale des arts décoratifs, with a specialization in cinema and video. Along with those degrees, she was awarded a scholarship from the Pépinière européens des jeunes artistes to undertake a residency in Finland where she lived from 2007 to 2008 while finishing her dissertation on representations of Joan of Arc in film.

The exhibition is organized by the Walker Art Center and curated by Bartholomew Ryan; Alise Upitis is the organizing curator for the List. The exhibition recently closed at the Walker Art Center and opens at the List on May 9, 2014.Yael Bartana (b. 1970) is an Israeli artist who lives and works in Berlin. A key theme in Bartana’s work is the investigation and then intervention in the processes by which communities convene, subjects are formed, national mythologies maintained, gendered behaviors enforced. The exhibition will feature her dynamic video trilogy, and Europe will be stunned, which has received considerable international attention since it debuted at the 54th Venice Biennale, where the artist represented the Polish Pavilion. and Europe will be stunned tells the story of the rise of the Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland, a quasi-fictional political group that calls for the return to that country of 3.3 million Jews. Ultimately, in a European context that has seen a resurgence in nationalism in recent years, the group becomes home to all who feel that citizenship should be organized around more than national, ethnic, or religious identity. Intimately invested in the legacy of modernism, Liam Gillick (b.1964) makes sculptures, text-based works, and publications that owe much to a working through of the failure of its Utopian promise to design a more egalitarian society. The exhibition will present a series of projects from the last 20 years of the artist’s production—from graphic vinyl wall texts, to giant Bloody Mary’s, to glitter carpets. What aligns the work is a concern for organization, how communities exist and are transformed in an era of ever increasing privatization.Natascha Sadr Haghighian abjures biography altogether, for instance she sees the artist résumé as a shorthand simplification that rates the individual according to past institutional affiliations, or regulates them according to conventional markers of identity (age, nationality, and so on). In 2004 she created bioswop.net for the free exchange and sharing of résumés and biographies. The exhibition will feature key works from the last several years that explore the precariousness of work and life today.Dutch artist Renzo Martens (b. 1973), who lives and works in Brussels and Kinshasa, is known for his satirical and disturbing video documentaries in which he travels to war-torn countries and places himself narcissistically at the center of the action, demonstrating how Western spectators consume distant trauma. For the List, he will present the work of the Institute for Human Activities, an organization he has founded dedicated to the transformation through artist-propelled gentrification of a former Unilever plantation 800 miles north of Kinshasa on the Congo River. New York-based artist Bjarne Melgaard (Norwegian, b. Australia, 1967) has produced a newly commissioned work that dispenses with his usual immersive and expressionistic installations in favor of a photographic memoir of his movements in the work. Disturbing and illuminating, they capture both the figure of the artist in seemingly candid documentation and also many of his works and installations. The cinematic quality of the presentation is accompanied by a new video and soundtrack developed with New York-based artist Marie Karlberg.Artist Nástio Mosquito’s approach (b. 1981 in Angola, lives and works in Luanda) finds form in his music, performances, and videos, and the exhibition will present a range of moving image works (including a newly commissioned piece) by one of the artists’ alter egos Nástia, a Russian accented prognosticator, who discourses about the world with a mixture of crude cliché, insight, and satirical self-help dogma. In a recent work, Mosquito declared, “I do represent, if you are willing, the army of the individuals.” This statement could serve as a guiding motto for every artist included in the exhibition. Their loyalty is to the individual, but not the individual who exists in isolation, rather one who acts within a community, even if this community has yet to be invented. The exhibition features Mosquito’s new video essay, Nástio Mosquito Answers Ryan Bartholomew produced in association with Vic Pereiró and leading out of the artist’s recent performance at the Walker. Since the 1990s, Hito Steyerl (b. 1966) has become one of the leading voices among artists who play with conventional formats of the documentary genre, borrowing from its reputation for objectivity while acknowledging its ongoing history as a means of propaganda and indoctrination. 9 Artists features her latest work How not to be seen. A fucking didactic educational .MOV file, which debuted at the Venice Biennale. The work continues her long meditation on the nature of the image in the digital age. Additionally, the exhibition includes Steyerl’s famous Red Alert (2007), which is composed of three computer monitors with monochromatic red glowing fields with which the artist claims to have reached the logical end of the documentary genre. The work of artist Danh Vo (Danish, b. 1975, Vietnam, lives and works in Basel) can be seen as a philosophy of practice that runs through his many projects, exhibitions, and relationships–a keen attention to art-historical precedence as well as geopolitics and the implications of living in a world that is more imbricated than ever before.  People, objects, history, and various identity formations all become material in his expanding and accumulating oeuvre, producing a profound portrait, not necessarily of himself, but of the complicities and complexities of life today. The exhibition will feature a new presentation of Vo’s recent Guggenheim Museum/Hugo Boss Prize exhibition, I M U U R 2, based on the personal archive of deceased Lower East Side painter (and founder of the Museum of American Graffiti) Martin Wong that he developed over many years in collaboration with his mother Florence Wong.Each artist has contributed a 16-page artist section exploring some aspect of their broad practice in relation to the exhibition, ranging from meditations on the Trayvon Martin social media campaign, to manifesto-like artist statements, and ghost-written letters between an artist and a dead anti-semitic philosopher.  The book has been produced in collaboration with other artists, writers, and designers, such as Karl Holmqvist, Phùng Vo, Galit Eilat, Vic Pereiró, Brendan Dugan of An Art Service, Federica Bueti, and others. The contributions are accompanied by a 32-page compendium of works, and a text by curator Bartholomew Ryan that weaves together their various approaches, placing them in the context of broader contemporary art practice. Designed and published by the Walker’s award winning design studio, the catalogue is available through Distributed Art Publishers.9 Artists is organized by the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.  Major support for the exhibition is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

The exhibition features nearly 60 distinctive quilts from the renowned collection and is the first to explore how, over five decades, trained artists Paul Pilgrim and Gerald Roy searched out and collected quilts with bold, eye-popping designs that echoed the work of mid-20th century Abstract Expressionist and Op Artists.\tThe exhibition opens with the vividly colored quilts that first drew the collectors’ attention and began their life-long passion. Exploring sophisticated principles of color theory, the exhibition’s opening sections display color vibrations, mixtures, gradations, and harmonies in the design of the quilts ranging from the 19th to early 20th century. As their collection grew, Pilgrim and Roy turned their interest to the history of quilting and added more traditional designs. Many of these incorporated the color white to create high contrast. The exhibition’s sections—“Variations” and “Optical Illusions”—examine the effect of color and pattern, highlighting dramatic color choices and innovative effects created within established quilt patterns. The exhibition concludes with a final nod to the artistic vision of quilt makers and highlights artists who worked outside of standard patterns and design.\t  Above: Double Wedding Ring Quilt, about 1940.

Four thematic sections—Power Parodied, Borders Redefined, Occupied Geometries, and Absence Accumulated—consider distinct aesthetic strategies that resonate within the artists’ cultural contexts and beyond. Their unique visual languages subvert status quo, defy boundaries, humanize art's abstractions, and revisit forgotten histories.

Rydz explores America's coasts, photographing the manufactured remnants of modern life that wash up on the shoreline. Plastic's resilience is exactly the quality that makes it valuable to us, but what we use, discard, and dump in the sea is useless to marine life. Materials that never decay become a permanent part of the oceanic ecosystem. Nature's attempt to reclaim these cast-offs fascinates Rydz, who draws our attention to their transformation on their long journey along the global ocean current, and to the larger implications of society's everyday actions. This exhibition is the first to include Rydz's bold photographs, which, combined with her delicate drawings, depict these fragments in surprising ways.\tPrior to receiving the SMFA’s prestigious Traveling Scholars Fellowship, Rydz’s research focused on the Atlantic.

Their mission was to prove the artistic merit of photography by strengthening its connections with the fine arts. To this end they made images that sought to represent truth and beauty; that were atmospheric; that had poetic, literary, or spiritual value; and that emphasized the role of the photographer as a craftsman. Figures such as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Frederick H. Evans, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Gertrude Käsebier, and Clarence H. White made spectacular images influenced by current art trends, including Impressionism, Symbolism, and the Arts and Crafts movement.The Pictorialists primarily utilized two printing processes: platinum, with its extraordinary tonal richness, and gum bichromate, a labor-intensive process that involved hand coating papers with carefully prepared emulsions and pigments. They often presented their images by mounting them on papers that were specially lined or colored, like fine art drawings, and they sometimes showed them in specially designed frames.\tThis exhibition celebrates the MFA’s recent acquisition of four major works related to the Boston leader of the movement, F. Holland Day. His The Seven Last Words (1898), purchased in 2013, is a centerpiece of the show and was recently called “an important touchstone of Modernist photography,” by The New York Times. Day daringly styled himself in this series as Christ wearing a crown of thorns. The other three photographs—portraits of Day by Edward Steichen, James Craig Annan, and Clarence H.

The exhibition commemorates the 55th anniversary of the Kyoto-Boston sister city relationship. When the painting first entered the MFA’s collection in 1911, it was mounted in four sections on thick paper. In recent years, the work was determined to have originally comprised eight paintings on sliding doors (fusuma) that would have been part of a larger set adorning the interior of a Buddhist temple hall. In preparation for its inclusion in a 2012 exhibition of the MFA’s masterpieces in Japan, the paintings were treated by specialists in the Museum’s Asian Conservation Studio. Five years ago they began the process by separating and repairing the damaged paintings, and preparing custom-made wooden lattice cores with multiple layers of paper on each side. The paintings were mounted on these modified fusuma panels and finished with an appropriate lacquer wooden trim. The MFA has long been widely recognized for its unparalleled collection of works by Shōhaku, including these works on view along with Dragon and Clouds: Hawk (about 1763) and two hanging scrolls by the artist from the late 1770s.\nDownload the Dragons Art Connections card and search for objects and images throughout the Museum to discover how different cultures viewed dragons, and get ideas for art-making activities.

No longer constrained by the requirements of commercial publishing, artists were able to exploit the color woodblock process as far as their imaginations could take them, and to experiment with new Western media as well.\n\tThis exhibition showcases the MFA’s holdings in the area of 20th-century Japanese prints, including both shin hanga made by the traditional collaborative method and sōsaku hanga produced by a single artist working alone. Prints are shown along with preliminary drawings, woodblocks, artists’ proofs, and variant versions printed from the same blocks, highlighting the interplay of creativity and technique in printmaking.\n\tA variety of materials, from Takei Takeo’s miniature artist books to large collaborative prints, gives visitors an intriguing behind-the-scenes look at the work of modern Japanese print artists.\n\tThe exhibition’s centerpiece is the complete set of the six large prints entitled Sailboats (1926) by Yoshida Hiroshi. This iconic work, probably the single best-known example of shin hanga, collaborative method, uses the same woodblocks printed in six different color schemes to show the boats at different times of day; the printing is so skillful that works from this series are sometimes mistaken for watercolors.\n\t \nAbove: Yoshida Hiroshi, Sailboats: Morning, from the series Inland Sea, Taisho era–Showa era, 1926.

More than 60 dramatic ceramics and baskets from the Snider Collection are complemented by contemporary Japanese quilts and fabric screens and an example of sophisticated paper sculpture, highlighting the revolution in these traditional media in creative abstraction.\n\t \nAbove: Sakurai Yasuko, Vertical Flower, Heisei era, 2007.

The opening of “Think Pink” in October coincides with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, when the MFA will be illuminated in pink.\t  Above: Doll's dress, 18th century.
