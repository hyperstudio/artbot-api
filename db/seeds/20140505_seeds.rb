She uses a method called \"the Square Root\" based on  the Mexican tradition of making clothing from squares and rectangles. This process emphasizes forms of fabric  and delicate, thoughtful construction based on whole fabric, as opposed to cutting in curves and molding to  the body.\nThe Barefoot Designer is multi-faceted exhibition consisting of garments, textiles, drawings, photographs, performance, video,  workshops and source materials demonstrating Fernández's multi-layered design process. A key component of that process is her design workshop Taller Flora, a mobile laboratory that collaborates with Mexico's indigenous communities, a sustainable business model based on close collaboration with and recognition of local knowledge and talent. During her  career, Fernández has worked with many indigenous communities throughout Mexico. The exhibition will highlight the styles and techniques of five states: Chiapas, Yucatan, Campeche, the State of Mexico and Mexico City.\nMobility and collaboration can be seen and felt throughout the exhibition: in its installation, multiple films and monthly dance  performances, as well as workshops for the public. The garments and mannequins are positioned on life-sized, mobile  displays. Fernández has also activated the garments through a live and filmed dance performance by dancers Raushan Mitchell  and Silas Reiner, bringing to life the notion of \"clothing as canvas.\" The exhibition will include short process videos of weavers, embroiderers, and carpenters by photographer and filmmaker Ramiro Chaves, as well as fashion films produced by Chaves and Pedro Torres in New York City, Boston and Mexico City. A series of fashion photos by photographer Graciela Iturbide will be on view. A large workshop table adds a hands-on visitor experience to the exhibition, with a variety of workshops scheduled. Fernández will run a two-day clothing workshop as well as workshops with the Gardner's School and  Community Partnership Programs.\n\"I want people to understand that you can find happiness many different ways, and one way is by creating goods by hand and making things unique to the artist,\" Fernández said. \"Discovering the process helps people to understand how these different worlds work, because you fall in love with the artisan, and then you fall in love with the piece. You can create a whole economy  based on the artists, and how their work is made.\"\nLearn more about Carla Fernández's residency at the Gardner Museum.\nCarla Fernández: The Barefoot Designer: A Passion for Radical Design and Community is made possible with generous support from The Coby Foundation, Ltd. and the National Endowment for the Arts, with additional assistance from the Consulate General of Mexico in Boston.

Creating a version of this quintessential Islamic image for her adopted city of Boston, the artist seeks to diffuse the prevailing tension between East and West by bringing visitors in contact with the unfamiliar through visual art.\n\"Last summer,\" Abbas says, \"I found this cheap plaster imitation of the Kaaba door in my mother's house in Lahore. It was hanging askew with a sizable layer of dust, which is not surprising for my mom, where chaos takes another meaning all together. However, it made me take notice of similar happenings in other places, while visiting friends and family and during my interaction with people in public spaces, so eventually I started documenting them. For me these small imperfections reveal the human element that co-exists with the seemingly monolithic ideals of truth and perfection.\"\nAbbas is the third artist invited to create site-specific work for the Gardner façade.

CORRESPONDENCE features design process and construction drawings of the new garden, as well as communications between the design team and contractors responsible for its construction. The exhibition centers on a pair of letters between Museum director Anne Hawley and Van Valkenburgh describing their aspirations for the new garden at the beginning of the design process. The exhibition also presents photographs that illustrate how greatly the garden has changed over the years.\nVan Valkenburgh’s design of the Monk’s Garden interprets the Museum’s meandering gallery layout, and the rich colors and textures of its idiosyncratic collection, in a contemporary landscape context. While the garden is accessible (weather permitting) from both the original Museum building and Renzo Piano’s new addition, it is not the primary connection between them, freeing it to focus instead on cultivating a sense of place. The garden is given its own interior, with the aim of provoking extended quiet contemplation rather than hurried passage.\nThe original high brick wall of Fenway Court surrounds the garden, and the design aims to soften this enclosure through the creation of a small-scale, dreamlike woodland. Composed of approximately 60 trees including stewartia, paper bark maple, and gray birch, the groves establish a detail-rich palette of colors and textures suitable for intimate appreciation. Winding paths, paved in a striking combination of black brick and reflective mica schist, meander through the trees. Rather than intersecting, the paths playfully meet and diverge, while also gently widening in places to create nooks for garden chairs.
